The machine that goes ping'' (see Monty Python's Meaning of Life'')
emits professional signal 'ping' in one second intervals.

Task: Write a short script emulating the work of ping 'machine'.
The sound 'ping' can be signalled using 'echo' command (see man 'echo'),
one second pause - using 'sleep' (see man 'sleep').

CAUTION : The script should work infinitely.

CAUTION 2: The script must not scroll the screen during its operations.

CAUTION 3: The script should have set permissions to execute for all entities (see man chmod'').
