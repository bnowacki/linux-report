Prompt string

Bourne Again Shell (bash), similarly to other UNIX shells utilises environmental variable PS1'' to store prompt string description. 
Willing to change it, it is enough to replace its value with a new one.
The most permanently looking effect can be obtained by performing adequate substitution in start script, 
which in case of bash is in ~/.bash_profile file (~ stands for the home directory of a user in question).
Prompt string can contain sequences like \x, where x - a character, which during printing of prompt will be interpreted and substituted with specific information, e.g. \t - actual time.
Description of other standard sequences can be found in man page concerning bash (man bash).

Task: Permamently set URL-like prompt of the form:

<shell-name>://<username>@<host>/<current-directory><caret-return (CR)>$
