The task is to inform the user being logging out about all processes he is leaving in the system.

During main session closing a shell (in this case bash)
executes ~/.bash_logout script, so this is the file that should be modified.

A process list can be obtained using 'ps' command (see man 'ps').
The print should contain parental relations among processes in the form of tree or forest (look for appropriate parameters).

After describing processes the user should be asked to hit any key,
after which the screen should be cleaned (see man 'clear').

Waiting on user prompt can be done using 'read' (see man 'bash'),
using which 1 character should be read without echo.
Maximal wait time can also be set.

CAUTION: The script should have set permissions to execute for all entities
