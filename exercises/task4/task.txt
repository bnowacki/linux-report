Some editors like 'jed' create backup copies of edited files by adding ~'' to their name.
As an example, the previous version of the file 'file.txt' will have name 'file.txt~'.

In case of severe fault in the program operating system can abort it,
putting its virtual memory dump in file 'core' (in current directory),
what can be used to to find the cause post mortem.

Task: Write a script cleaning 'user' home directory and all it's subdirectories from those kinds of files.
The command 'find' can be used to search appropriate files (see man 'find').

CAUTION: Search should be started from 'user' home dir. Do not search entire file system.

CAUTION 2: The script should have permissions to execute for all entities (see man 'chmod').
