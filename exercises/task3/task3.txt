Command 'uname' prints (depending on options used ) various informations about host (see manual).
'id' command can provide information about user, his main and auxiliary groups etc. (see manual).

Task: Write a short script printing (in consecutive lines) information helpful to absent-minded user:

        username,
        main group name,
        all group names, to which the user belongs,
        hostname, on which he is working,
        current directory name.

CAUTION: The script should have permissions to execute for all entities (see 'man chmod').
