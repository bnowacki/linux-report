Bash internal command 'alias' is dedicated to renaming existing commands. 
It is also possible to create a new command based on existing one be passing additional parameters to it, e.g.

alias l='ls -l'

From this moment, invocation of newly created command 'l' is equivalent to 'ls -l'.
New name can be identical to the one already defined, what can be used to change a default behaviour of redefined command.
The most permanent effect can be obtained by placing aliases in shell's start script (see Problem 1).
Detailed description of alias command can be found in bash man page (man bash).

'rm' removes files.
'cp' and 'mv', in specific conditions, also lead to deletion of files.
Each of them has parameters, passing of which prevents cp and mv from file removal without earlier user permission.
Parameters can be found in manuals.
